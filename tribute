				<p> Throughout my whole life my parents have supported me and backed me up everytime I needed it. Throughout my almost 15 years of life they have never given up on me regardless of how many times I mess up, and that is a debt I can never repay. Whatever I needed was provided, and so was everything I wanted for that matter.</p>
